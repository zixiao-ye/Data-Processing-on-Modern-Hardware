# Readme 
This is the first assignment of *Data Processing On Modern Hardware*.
Please have a look at the assignment sheet you find on the course's webpage or in our Moodle.

## Introduction
- **Fork** this repo to do the assignment.
- There's a GitLab CI that will check if all required files exist.
- Passing the CI does not mean that you get the exam point! We'll double-check uploads.

## First Part
 - Implement the methods in `src/cache_access.c`.
 - Build the project with `make`, `make normal` or `make tester`.
 - You can try own configurations with the `assignment` ELF created by `make`.
 - Test your implementation with the `tester` ELF created by `make tester`.

## Second part
- Play around with the project and test different configurations (see assignment sheet).
- You are free to modify `src/main.c` according to your needs!
- Write down your findings in a `report.pdf` and add it to the repo.
- This does not need to be an essay, so keep it short. Bullet points are fine!
- You are free to visualize your findings!
