 * Volcano (Tuple-at-a-time), Columnar (Operator-at-a-time), Batch-Processing (Vector-at-a-time),
 * and Just-in-time compilation. 
 * The class provides a custom aligned allocator by overloading the new and delete operators.
 * This helps to avoid false sharing of cache lines during volcano execution.
