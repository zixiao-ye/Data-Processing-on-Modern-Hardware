# Hardware optimized hash joins

## Introduction
- **Fork** this repo to do the assignment.
- There's a GitLab CI that will check if all required files exist.
- Passing the CI does not mean that you get the exam point! We'll double-check uploads.

Compile by executing the command
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```

## Submission of this homework:
Commit your changes and push them into your GitLab repository so that we can see them.

## Files you need to modify:
* `OptimizedHashJoins.cpp`

Hint: take a look at `Relation.hpp`


## Description of this project:

Your tasks are described the assignment sheet.  
The programming language of this homework is C++. 
We provide you a simple code skeleton, feel free to add functions or change the function signatures if needed.
Feel free to add functions or change the existing ones.

Note: In case you encounter any errors regarding cmake, you might need to run:
